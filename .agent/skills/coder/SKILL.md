# Goal
Execute the technical plan by writing high-quality, battery-efficient, and "Rugged" Android code.

# Instructions
1. **Read the Plan:** Strictly follow the instructions in `PLAN.md`.
2. **Follow Standards:** Adhere to `coding-standards.md` (Clean Architecture, MVVM).
3. **Rugged UI:** Apply the `style-guide.md` to all Compose components (8dp corners, high contrast).
4. **Self-Check:** Ensure all new files are correctly package-scoped (data, domain, ui).

# Constraints
- Use `val` for immutability.
- No third-party libraries unless specified in `architecture.md`.
